The purpose of the lab is to test generic and non-generic fucntions using method overloading to print non-generic methods.With generics, a single defnition of a non primary type can be used to define all data types like ints or strings.

I created method printArray which accepts an array as an input paremeter and uses the built-in toString function to implement the array.
Per the lab instrcutions, I also created a generic function with type parameter T that defines the data types for the raw types.
The comparable functions for both the generic and non-generic implementations did the same job of going through each array and find the largest value in terms of string, double, ints or chars and returns the max value.
I created a main function which then calls the above functions and prints all the data types.
