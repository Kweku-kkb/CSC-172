The purpose of the task is to print a 4*4 2D from elements in a set ended in a set in a 4*4 matrix form. 

I created 3 methods, one main method which calls the array and arraylist functions to print. 
The array and arraylist methods both loop through the set of elements and prints the positions according to the columns and rows.
