The folder contains 3 files Read.java, StopContagion.java and Node.java. My program works for the first part as expexcted. 
However, for the second part my Ball() and SigmaBall() functions return as smaller list than expected when I do BFS on the graph. 
Thus, the influence calculated for each of the nodes is dependent on the influence of the first neighbor, not all the neighbours. 
I had thought of a DFS algorithm which could potentially fix the issue, but the prompt speifiys BFS, therefore i did not explore that path.
